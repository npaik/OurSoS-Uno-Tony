# Guidelines for Front-End Development on OurSOS

## Fork the Repository

Dear developers, to contribute to the OurSoS front-end, follow these guidelines:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Before you start making changes, fork the OurSoS front-end repository on GitHub. Make sure to uncheck the "main branch" checkmark when forking.
    After forking, clone the forked repository locally.

## GitHub Workflow

2. **Push to Your Fork:** Please do not push your changes directly to the main OurSoS repository. Instead, push your changes to your forked repository.

3. **Make a Pull Request:** Once you've made your changes and are ready to contribute, create a pull request from your forked repository to the main SOS repository. Provide a clear description of the changes you've made and the problem they solve.

4. **Sync with the Main Branch:** It's important to regularly synchronize your forked repository with the main branch of the OurSoS repository. This helps you stay up-to-date with the latest changes in the main branch.

By following these guidelines, you'll help us maintain a clean and organized development process for the OurSoS front-end. Thank you for your contributions!
